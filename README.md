# Video-Analysis-for-pattern-recognition
13 participants pointed a laser towards a marked target. For each participant 2 videos recording the lasers fluctuations were taken (1 video per arm). The videos were then processed by splitting them into frames. Using Python's OpenCV package we identified the center of mass of the reference point (target) and the average position of the laser. With the positions of the laser around the target a series of statistical analysis were performed (for instance, time series analysis, DFA analysis, analysis of the jump the laser made between frames).
